            COVID 19 Global Hackathon <br/>
            Created a website that would allow for users to find other people within their nearby neighbors
            and connect with them. This was intended to create a stronger sense of community, allow for
            local trading, sharing, and selling of goods, and improve people's mental health. <br/>
